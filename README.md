# GitStalker
Stalk/Track whoever you want on Github

No longer do you have to scour that list of profiles to see what they're upto. Just add those usernames to the users.config file, and sit back as the simple script scours the depths of Github for you.

P.S: The script is quite basic, but hey I saved you from having to type it :)
Upcoming features:
1. Currently shows last 30 days. Later will add ability to only show diff from the last time you ran it.
2. Will add support for other events if needed. Currently just tracks commits.

Possible bugs:
1. May not work for certain accounts if their Git config isn't the same as their Github configuration. Will remedy this in the future
